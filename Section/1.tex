\section{Data Introduction}
\subsection{Dataset descriptions}

The graphics processing unit \textbf{(GPU)} has become one of the most important types of computing technology, both for personal and business computing. Designed for parallel processing, the GPU is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering. Although theyâ€™re best known for their capabilities in gaming, GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).

With the rapid advancement of computer graphics and visualization technologies, GPUs have become essential components in a wide range of applications, including gaming, scientific research, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.

For that reason, this report aims to predict memory speed based on different GPUs by analyzing GPUs' attributes such as Memory\_Speed, Memory, Memory\_Bus, etc., in the dataset.

Data descriptions for the 13 variables are as follows:
